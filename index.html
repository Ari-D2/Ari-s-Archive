<h1> Ari's Archive </h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Ari Defosses, and this is my digital portfolio. <br>This contains my collection of projects from <em>ART: 222 Digital Design</em> with Professor Janna. We learn about designing logos, photo manipulation, video art, and interactive projection.</br> <em>Welcome and enjoy the art!</em> </p>

<p> <b>Project 1: 2D Digital Design- Creating Logos</b> <br> Throughout this project section we were tasked with creating a logo design for a company. We were given the Southworth Planetarium as our subject. Using the USM website, as well as any fellow website or social media pages involving the planetarium, we researched the background.</br> Task in mind I created this logo below with the idea of their younger audience. The planetarium can be a bit scary and this sort of whimsical logo would help young kids know it is actually fun. There are many things I drew inspiration from and with them in mind, I created a planet out of 9 lines to represent the planets, star clusters imitating real clusters and the night sky, a large telescope across the planet, a large abbreviated name (SP), as well as the USM colors. These elements all create a fun and inviting logo. <br>Below is my final logo design: </br> </p>

<p> <b>Project 2: Photo Manipulation- Create Your Own Cryptids</b> <br>In this project section we were tasked with creating our very own cryptids drawing inspiration from others to create a whole brand-spanking new creature. We had to create a backstory/idea of how this creature was made, how it would affect the ecosystem, and any other extra details we would like to embellish. My creation below is called the MaineCoon Maiden due to the fact she is a mix of a Maine Coon cat and a woman. In short, her backstory is that she was cursed during the settler times by a Native American tribe. She had killed their prized Maine Coon that somehow brought strange omens and warned them of great destruction coming to the village. Now she is doomed to roam forever in the Maine area warning people who come across her about great tragedies coming to their lives. Below is my final design: </br> </p>

<p> <b>Project 3: Video Art- Create Your Own Appropriation Video Art</b> <br>In this project we were tasked with developing our own video art using videos from either Archive.org or any website like YouTube and appropriating it into our own art style videos. For my creation, I collected many videos from YouTube with inspiration from the 2016 movie Nerve. My project was a sort of commentary on the ongoing wars, the destruction of the earth, and capitalism. I question whether or not the viewer will be a watcher or a player. Will they stand by and watch as things worsen never doing anything to help those in need, or will be a player and take action against the system and help those in need? </br> </p>
<p> This is my video project: <a href = "https://youtu.be/hJzeQkprs-Y?si=fMZ1qorlb0198y3t">Video Project </a> </p>
<p> <b>Project 4: Projection Video Project- Create your own video projection</b> <br>In this project we learned a crash course on TouchDesigner and Arduino to produce our own video projection. Learning our own boards and slowly adding in data that the professor wanted us to add. This was a tester period of this type of this project and we all seemingly liked it. My project had the idea of producing this as a setup in an entire room that had music playing matching the pace of the videos. The music and videos would provide a sense of tranquility that these slow-paced hypnotic videos provide. My inspiration was from the Vincent van Gouhg pop-up museums that were showing up in Europe in 2023. </br> </p>

<p> This is how my project will work <a href = "https://youtu.be/1fULosTFalA?si=soP_NyOOdwBQ7h5u"> video of how my project </a> </p>
