<h1> Ari's Archive </h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Ari Defosses and this my digital portfolio. <br>This contains my collection of projects from <em>ART: 222 Digital Design</em> with Professor Janna. We learn designing logos, photo manipulation, video art, and interactive projection.</br> <em>Welcome and enjoy the art!</em> </p>

<p> <b>Project 1: 2D Digital Design- Creating Logos</b> <br> Throughout this project section we were tasked with creating a logo design for a company. We were given the Southworth Planetarium as our subject. Using the USM website, as well as any fellow website or social media pages involving the planetarium, we researched the background.</br> Task in mind I created this logo below with the idea of their younger audience. The planetarium can be a bit scary and this sort of whimsical logo would help young kids know it is actually fun. There are many things I drew inspiration from and with them in mind I created a planet out of 9 lines to represent the planets, star clusters imitating real clusters and the night sky, a large telescope across the planet, large abbreviated name (SP), as well as the USM colors. These elements all create a fun and inviting logo. Below is my final logo design: </p>

<p> <b>Project 2: Photo Manipulation- Create Your Own Cryptids</b> <br>In this project section we were tasked with creating our very own cryptids drawing inspiration from others to create a whole brand spanking new creature. We had create a backstory/idea of how this creature was made, how it would affect the ecosystem, and any other extra details we would like to embellish. My creation bellow is called the MaineCoon Maiden due to the fact she is a mix of a Maine Coon cat and a woman. In short her backstory is that she was cursed during the seattler times by a Native American tribe. She had killed their prized Maine Coon that somehow brought strange omens and warned them of great destruction coming to the village. Now she is doomed to roam forever in the Maine area warning people who come across her about great tragedies coming to their life. Below is my final design: </br> </p>
